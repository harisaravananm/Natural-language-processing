# Natural-language-processing

This project demonstrates the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing libraries, spaCy and Stanford NLP (Stanza), to perform key NLP tasks including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and dependency parsing.

Features
Fast and efficient tokenization and POS tagging with spaCy

Accurate dependency parsing and NER using Stanford NLP (Stanza) models

Easy interoperability between spaCy and Stanza pipelines

Example scripts showing text processing, entity extraction, and syntactic analysis
